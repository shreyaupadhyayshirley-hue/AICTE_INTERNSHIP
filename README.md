### Project Description 
This Smart Irrigation System uses real-time soil moisture data from sensors and an AI model to predict which fields need watering. It helps farmers save water and ensures crops get just the right amount of irrigation.

**Smart Irrigation Using Soil moisture and Weather Data**
1.A machine learning-based system that automates irrigation by analyzing real-time soil moisture sensor data.

2.Predicts which fields need watering using a trained AI model, ensuring efficient water usage.

3.Controls sprinklers (pumps) automatically to avoid over- or under-irrigation.

4.Aims to support farmers by saving water, reducing manual work, and improving crop health.
